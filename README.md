# Smart-Surveillance-System

# **Introduction**
The Smart Surveillance System is an AI-driven, real-time security solution designed to enhance safety and automate threat detection. Traditional surveillance relies on manual monitoring, which is inefficient and prone to human errors. Our system integrates facial recognition with an automated alert system, providing real-time SMS notifications to security personnel.

🏆 **Problem Statement**
Security threats such as unauthorized intrusions, theft, and privacy violations are common in manually monitored surveillance systems. These challenges arise due to:

**Delayed Intruder Detection** – CCTV footage is reactive, not proactive.

**Human Error in Monitoring** – Security guards cannot monitor 24/7 without fatigue.

**Lack of Instant Alerts** – No immediate notification system for unauthorized entries.

✅ **Key Features**
✔ Live Facial Recognition – Detects unauthorized individuals in real-time.
✔ Automated Security Alerts – Sends instant notifications via Twilio API.
✔ Seamless Multi-Threaded Processing – Ensures smooth and lag-free performance.
✔ Fire Detection – Detects fire incidents and notifies the fire department.
✔ Cloud-Ready Deployment – Scalable across multiple devices and cloud platforms.
✔ Smart Lock Integration – Can control locks, alarms, and remote access systems.

🏗️ **Architecture**
The Smart Surveillance System operates using a modular AI and Computer Vision approach:

📌 **AI & Computer Vision:**
Face Recognition – Identifies and classifies individuals.

*OpenCV* – Image processing and real-time video analysis.

*NumPy* – High-performance array computations for facial recognition.

*Math* – Calculates recognition confidence levels.

📌 **Alert System:**
*Twilio SMS API* – Sends instant text alerts.

*Twilio Voice API* – Makes automated calls to security personnel.

*Twilio WhatsApp API* – Sends WhatsApp notifications for intrusions.

📌 **Backend & Processing:**
Python – Core development language for AI and automation.

🔧 **Tech Stack**
